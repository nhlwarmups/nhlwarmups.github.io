          <h3 class="section-title"> Background </h3>
            <p> Welcome to <strong>nhlwarmups.github.io</strong>! This project was born from a passion for beautiful jersey designs 
            and a belief in the power of collaborative art. Although counter-inclusive player ideology has largely dominated recent 
            theme-night dialogue, I wanted to make this database to remember the good that <em>does</em> exist—and most of all to pivot the lens of attention toward not those on the ice who choose to either reject or embrace 
            these designs but rather those responsible for creating them in the first place.</p>
            
            <p> In contrast to years past—when there might have only been a shirt, a logo, or nothing at all—many teams have taken recent strides to 
              work with local and independent artists to ice their warm-up jerseys. Sure, maybe it won't all last, and maybe some markets won't ever really get there. 
              But I still believe that the work being done in spite of surrounding tension only makes it more meaningful!
            
            <h3 class="section-title"> Disclaimer </h3>
            <p> Since I couldn't find a centralized location with every design and its associated information collected in one place,
              I decided to make this site myself. However, taking this task on definitely made me realize why it didn't exist yet: save for the Hockey Fights Cancer and Military Appreciation stock
              template, the whole point of artist designs is that they reject standardization, so compiling projects across 32 (potential) teams required some effort! </p>

            <p> As a result,  <strong>this database currently only catalogs themed jerseys made in collaboration with publicized artists</strong>. Some teams have collaborated
            with artists for other apparel (shirts, shoes, hats), and some teams have also worn warm-up jerseys created in-house, without naming their designers on social media or in 
            any articles. I would like to expand this database to include in-house warm-up jerseys and other apparel if I ever find the time, but this remains the focus for now :) </p>

          <p> Because this database is all the work of one person, it's highly possible that some entries might be missing, incorrect,
            or otherwise lacking. If you'd like to help out or offer feedback on any part of the site,
            I can be contacted at <strong>nhlwarmups@gmail.com</strong>!
            
          <span style="color: var(--grey);"> (Small disclaimer to expect some delays because I will probably not be great at
          checking my inbox, but I'll try my best to implement any feedback I do see :D) </span> </p>
